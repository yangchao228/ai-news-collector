They're **very smooth and good-looking**, and they can make eye contact, and they're smiling all the time. Super pro. Very likeable.\n\nAnd their models are way cheaper! Like half as expensive!\n\nAll Dario does is prattle on about how \"You have to get ready for what's coming!\", and, \"Here's what we're doing to make this transition easier for humans.\", and, \"Hey government, you can't use our stuff for gross shit.\"\n\nNerdy, boring, and *not cool-sounding*.\n\n**And** they're fucking with my MAX subscription?\n\n**And** they have higher API prices?\n\nFuck them and their \"trying to help the world survive AI\" mission. I'm not Gandhi; I'm trying to build a SaaS app (URL below btw).\n\nI want Anthropic's product at other companies' prices, and I want to be able to use it how I want to use it.\n\nAnthropic owes me that.\n\nSo that's why I hate them and you should too.\n</body></html>"
